## 4. Tex software for creating PDF documents.

Downloaded MiKTeX from http://miktex.org
downloaded executable & installer. Downloaded Tex to C:\Users\Shady\AppData\Local\Programs\MiKTeX
options chosen:
- A4 paper
- ask me first before installing packages

### Create the RMarkdown to PDF

had to install package markdown
- gave output but it disappeared and brought up the markdown window. 

gave the following output:
processing file: knit_test.Rmd

! Sorry, but C:\Users\Shady\AppData\Local\Programs\MiKTeX\miktex\bin\x64\pdflatex.exe did not succeed.

! The log file hopefully contains the information to get MiKTeX going again:

!   C:\Users\Shady\AppData\Local\MiKTeX\miktex\log\pdflatex.log

! pdflatex: major issue: So far, you have not checked for MiKTeX updates.

Error: LaTeX failed to compile knit_test.tex. See https://yihui.org/tinytex/r/#debugging for debugging tips. See knit_test.log for more info.
Execution halted

so it FAILED.

trying again by restarting RStudio and starting from the beginning (File -> New File...)
- this gave the same output

I've had issues with using R in OneDrive directories, so I tried in a directory outside of OneDrive. Same result given. Seems to be an issue with the Tex software

Bc all the log files say I haven't checked for updates, I'm checking now on the app for MiKTeX.
- there are a lot of updates that are required. I'm doing this and then will try Rmarkdown again
- gave same output & error as before. Will look into this tomorrow before class. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------stopped here



Now try to create a test document from RStudio. **Go to File -> New File -> Rmarkdown...**

You (probably) will be prompted to install a package. Do so. Record in your notebook the package name and any output from that step. 

Now, create a new Rmarkdown file. Leave it "Untitled", but **change the default output format to PDF.** 

It will open a file for editing, but j_ust click on the ball of yarn with the word Knit next to it_. Save it as knit_test. This should open a new window with the document in PDF format. **Record whether you see this document, or any errors that might have popped up in the console.**

If it didn't work, try restarting RStudio and repeat the "Create the RMarkdown to PDF" steps. Record in your notebook if this is necessary.

## 5. Install more R packages.
tidyverse - installed. when used libary(), gave the following conflicts:
x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

BiocManager - installed. had to restart R due to loading packages in tidyverse that were dependencies in BiocManager

biomaRt - installed. Chose 'n' when asked whether I wanted to update other packages. not sure why this was the choice wanted, though. maybe other packages installed
are shared in this one and therefore the most recent one was downloaded?

## 6. Compilers for R source packages

Not now. We'll do #6 as needed.
